## Original Proposal
By Gerald B. Imbugwa, Enombe Ewane, Harrif Saliu, and Boburmirzo Khamrakulov.

### Introduction
Despite today’s advancements in technology, it is still common to notice
all food points in the campus accept orders over the counters
while relying on their best efforts for delivery.
IU students might frequently have unforeseen changes in
their programs or anticipate a possible absence to a scheduled meal plan
for a particular day and in that case, stands the risk of not having
time to eat for an already paid meal.

### Objectives
* Make eating plan schedules more flexible
* Reduce the pain of moving between floors after a tiring day
* Exposure to larger pool of dishes to choose from.
* Enhance the feeding experience of UI student.
* Higher possibility for customized feeding plan to the highest extend.

### Project Description and Features
We propose a delivery app that will allow IU students to better their
feeding experience within the University and also one through which
the canteen can offer a better experience.
The student will be able to choose with ease already preconfigured meal combo
from a variety of arrays from different cafes within the campus and
living areas.

Students will be able to order for their meals and be delivered to
their preferred destination on prefered delivery time. Apart from this,
they also can schedule a pick-up and cancel the order one hour
prior to delivery.
The student can make an order which the canteen will
receive in realtime and act upon it.

Main features include:
* Getting all food point update menu of each café in the campus for the next day.
* Ability to order food snacks at the comfort of your seat/room.
* Choose delivery time
* Ability cancel order 1hr to delivery
* Have accountable to schedule pickup of delivery 

### Target customers
**Busy students** — During strict deadlines and a high volume of studies
students can easily order foods without distractions.

**Innopolis hosts** — they can also check the meal menu and use
food delivery service while they are staying at University.
